# üöÄ 90 Days of DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my **#90DaysOfDevOps** journey! This repository documents my daily learning, hands-on practice, and resources while I explore and master DevOps concepts step-by-step.

## üéØ Goal

To build strong foundational knowledge and practical skills in DevOps over 90 days by focusing on:

- Linux fundamentals
- Networking basics
- Cloud (AWS)
- Containers (Docker)
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Monitoring, Logging, and more
